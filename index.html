          <p>After trying to get my head around lots of different software, I settled on using Algodoo (previously named Phun) for testing what my robot's walking motion might behave like. The nice thing about it, aside from seeing the actual motion path of the legs, will be that I can look at some of the forces involved and adjust the parts accordingly.</p>
        
        <p>My main problem this month has been that my Mac is its last legs. Switching it off is always a gamble as I don't know if I'll ever hear that familiar boot chime again.</p>
        
        <p>Anyway, I'm sharing this because initially I wanted to use Autodesk Inventor, a Windows application. If you are a student I highly recommend you to register for their student scheme where you can get every Autodesk product for free. After beating my HDD into submission and finally getting Boot Camp running I quickly ran out of disk space so eventually gave up and resorted to using kiddy physics simulators.</p>
        
        <p>The video below shows my first attempt at creating spur gears (cogs) haha</p>
        
        <iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/7S8HxJ-PneI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
        
        <p>My next step will be to try and export what I design in more powerful software in a format that Algodoo understands. Whilst there are a couple of projects out there - svg2phun and an inscape plugin called phn_output - they seem quite dated and only have Japanese documentation.</p>
        
        <p>Wish me luck!</p>

          <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

          <p>I decided to create a very simple mobile-friendly joystick.</p>
        
        <p>My plan is to attach a Spark Core to the robot allowing it to both send and receive commands over Wifi.</p>
        
        <p><img alt="Spark Core" src="http://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Spark-Core-Board-590x331.jpg" /></p>
        
        <p>The primary aim will be to have the ability to send movement commands… so to begin with I will implement 8-way joystick movement. Forward and Backward will simply require changing the direction of the motors, but left and right will mean that one side rotates forward whilst the other remains still or rotates backwards.</p>
        
        <p><strong>You can test the joystick in the area below. Click/Touch and drag, it should show your movement direction at the bottom of the window.</strong></p>

          <p>I researched a lot of different mechanisms, but finally settled on the proposed on <a href="http://mechanicalspider.com/concept.html">http://mechanicalspider.com/concept.html</a></p>
        
        <p><img alt="walking" src="http://mechanicalspider.com/elements/gifs/e005.gif" /></p>
        
        <p>It is called the Klann Linkage, and is similar to the now famous Strandbeest, but seemingly simpler to implement and more suitable for motors.</p>

        <p>I found an <a href="https://code.google.com/p/theeyestheywalk/">existing project</a>, and wanted to see how the mechanism behaved so I took the cad files, modified them very slightly and then laser cut them out of cardboard.</p>

          <p>I was being slowed down by the new parametric tools so to give myself a bit of a 'confidence boost' I decided to model it quickly in Rhinocerous. A tool that I used frequently last year in Fab Lab Barcelona.</p>
        
        <p>I asked the following question a few times</p>
        
        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/robotchallenge">@robotchallenge</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/arduino">@arduino</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/RSComponents">@rscomponents</a> is there a scale/dimension diagram of the robot available anywhere?

        <p>but wasn't getting anywhere with it, so I decided to make a scale model in Rhino with the promise to improve it in time.</p>

          <p>Within no time I'd whisked my robot off to its new home at <a href="http://www.fablabsitges.org">Fab Lab Sitges</a> and was tearing to pieces.</p>

        <p>Early on I decided that I'd try to discard the top (controller board) and create a dock solely for the bottom (motor board).</p>
        
        <p>This will be more challenging as it will probably require adding some custom firmware to the microcontroller, but <em>fingers crossed</em> I don't think it should take too much effort. The upside is that it will be easier to move around because there is less size/weight to worry about.</p>

          <p>Woah! Today marks the beginning of the crazy project that is OffRobot!</p>
        
        <p>Within a mere 48 hours of being notified that I was one of the 10 finalists, there was my robot. Neatly packaged and waiting to be played with. This is going to be exciting!</p>

          <p>I should probably start off with a quick introduction… Hi. I'm John and I'm a programmer from the UK. Typically I'm found working with servers/websites and apps, although whenever the opportunity arises I like to challenge myself with physical hardware.</p>
        
        <p><img alt="Hi" src="../../../images/hi.jpg" /></p>
        
        <p>Last year I did the Fab Academy in Fab Lab Barcelona and I really fell for the city. Since then, together with my trusty dying macbook, I've been whizzing backwards and forwards between European cities in an effort to pursue some sort of 'digital nomadic' lifestyle.</p>
        
        <p>I chose to enter this competition because I love playing with arduinos and have fond childhood memories of moving the little turtle around in LOGO. So the Arduino Robot seemed like the perfect fit!</p>
