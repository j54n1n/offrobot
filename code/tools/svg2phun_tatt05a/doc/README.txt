Objective:

  This program converts data between SVG format and Phun format.
  The SVG format is supported by Adobe Illustrator and Inkscape.
  This program also supports layers and groups of objects.

Usage 1:

  Drag and drop a SVG file and/or Phun file to svgXphun2.exe,
  generating converted file(s) in the folder where the original file(s) exists.
  
  You can configure default properties of objects by editing config.txt.

Usage 2:

   > svg2phun file.svg
            or
   > phun2svg file.phn

How converted?

   (1) This program converts closed paths
       Bezier curves, polygon, rectangle, circle, ellipse are supported.
       
   (2) Stroke and Collision option.
       Line Strokes specify collision with objects.
       A object with no line belongs to no collison group.
       A object with a dashed-line or no line does not collide with water.
       
   (3) Hinge and non-filled circle
       A circle without fill color will be converted to a hinge.
       
   (4) Fixjoint (Fixate)
       addFixjoint.svg will be converted to a fixjoint.
       
   (5) Spring and line
       a line will be converted to a spring.  The width of a line
       corresponds to width of a spring.  When lines are closed to
       represent a polygon, they are converted to a polygon. 
       
   (6) Plane and line
       A plane will be converted from a line both of which endpoints are not
       linked any object.  When either of the endpoints are lined with
       some objects, the line is converted to a spring.
       
   (7) Pen and non-filled dashed-line circle 
       A circle with dashed-line without fill color is converted to a pen.
       
   (8) Layers and groups
       Objects in the same layer and/or the same group is converted to
       the objects having a common body number in Phun file.  This is
       alternative function of the fixate.
       
   (9) A compound path is not supported.
       This is responsible to Phun :^)
       
   (10) Illustrator
       SVG data generated by Adobe-Illustrator does well.
       
   (11) Inkscape
       Use "Inkscape SVG" format rather than "plain SVG."
       
   (12) Controlling parameters
       The various parameters of phun objects are stored in id-tags of
       SVG format.  
       
       Illustrator:
          Use "Layer Panel"
       
       Inkscape:
          Use "XML editor"
       
       The format is,
          <id=key:value;key:value; .... >

Perl script;
   Perl script enclosed in this package is optional.
   If you prefer perl, you can use svg2phun.pl rather than svg2phun.exe.
   The usage is also simple:
   
   % svg2phun2.pl file.svg
   
   This command generates file.phn in the folder having file.svg.
   svg2phun2.pl requires two modules:
      (1)  SVG::Parser 
      (2)  Math::Bezier::Convert
   You can get them at CPAN.
   
   Have a good Phun life. :)  0:56 2008/11/08 by tatt61880
