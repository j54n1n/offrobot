        <p>So today I started to replace plywood components with PLA. It made a big improvement to the sturdiness of the model.</p>

        <p>This was the first of many iterations during the printing process. It quickly became apparent that this blue was far too high above the gears and was causing the legs to twist when they walked. I managed to remedy this but wish I'd spent more time simulating the movement in 3D software rather than guessing it from some 2D flash animations I made.</p>

        <p>Before RobotChallenge I will redesign the gear system, using Inventor, as the motors are having a lot of trouble powering the movement of the legs. Now that I have access to a printer I can make much finer teeth on the spur gears, and even have them at angles as shown below.</p>

        <p>I plan on making the central gear much smaller than it is now, and the two gears connected to the legs much larger. This will increase the torque of the system and mean that the legs move at a slower, more controlled pace.</p>
        
        <p>I also plan on changing the gait (walk-cycle) of the robot. Right now it looks a bit frantic! If only I had simulation software like Disney Research'sâ€¦</p>
