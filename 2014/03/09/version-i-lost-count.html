        <p>Still not quite there, so I don't want to waste loads of PLA and print the thing just yet. I am getting very close though, unfortunately this is turning out to be a bit of a nightmare task!</p>

        <p>I also learnt a neat trick from Andrew Leek at the lab.

The prints are coming out great and they have a super smooth base which is perfect for reducing friction.</p>
