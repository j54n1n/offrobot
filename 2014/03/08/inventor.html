        <p>After much faffing around I finally decided to model and simulate the robot with Inventor 2014</p>

        <p>This is the first time I've used the software but with a little help I was able to grasp the basics.</p>
        
        <p>I struggled with exporting the models for the laser cutter for a while, eventually I found that you can select a face and then 'export face as' and save it to a dxf. Once you do that you will probably need to open the dxf and save it as an older version (2000) if you wish to import it into Rhino/Illustrator/Inkscape etc.</p>
