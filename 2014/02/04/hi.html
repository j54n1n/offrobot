        <p>I should probably start off with a quick introductionâ€¦ Hi. I'm John and I'm a programmer from the UK. Typically I'm found working with servers/websites and apps, although whenever the opportunity arises I like to challenge myself with physical hardware.</p>

        <p>Last year I did the Fab Academy in Fab Lab Barcelona and I really fell for the city. Since then, together with my trusty dying macbook, I've been whizzing backwards and forwards between European cities in an effort to pursue some sort of 'digital nomadic' lifestyle.</p>
        
        <p>I chose to enter this competition because I love playing with arduinos and have fond childhood memories of moving the little turtle around in LOGO. So the Arduino Robot seemed like the perfect fit!</p>
