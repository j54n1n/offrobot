        <p>As you probably know, the Arduino Robot is infact two Arduinos (Leonardos) on seperate boards, that communicate as a master/slave over I2C(?).</p>
        
        <p>The top board, the Control Board, behaves like a typical Arduino and it can send commands to the lower, Motor Board.</p>

        <p>The Motor Board simply responds to commands, it can however run without being connected to the upper board. The issue is that with default firmware it has very limited functionality.</p>

        <p>My electronics plans for this project are relatively straightforward. I want to send movement commands to the robot and receive feedback from sensors, such as strain on the motors and possibly things like temperature of the ground. For now I am happy testing the robot using just the lower board, but soon I will probably have to reflash it in order to use the IO pins without the upper board connected.</p>
