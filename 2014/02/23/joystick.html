        <p>I decided to create a very simple mobile-friendly joystick.</p>
        
        <p>My plan is to attach a Spark Core to the robot allowing it to both send and receive commands over Wifi.</p>
        
        <p><img alt="Spark Core" src="http://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Spark-Core-Board-590x331.jpg" /></p>
        
        <p>The primary aim will be to have the ability to send movement commandsâ€¦ so to begin with I will implement 8-way joystick movement. Forward and Backward will simply require changing the direction of the motors, but left and right will mean that one side rotates forward whilst the other remains still or rotates backwards.</p>
        
        <p><strong>You can test the joystick in the area below. Click/Touch and drag, it should show your movement direction at the bottom of the window.</strong></p>
